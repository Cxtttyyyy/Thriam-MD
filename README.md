# Thriam-MD
You can create Whatsapp Multi Device session files with my programs.

Execute the following codes in CMD or Termux.

1. git clone https://github.com/Thriam/Thriam-MD
2. cd Thriam-MD
3. npm install
4. node index.js

and the file will be saved as "session.data.json" which can be renamed as "Thriam.json" at your convenience and be used in elsewhere.
