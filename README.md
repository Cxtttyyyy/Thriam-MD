You can create Whatsapp Multi Device session files with my programs.

Execute the following codes in CMD or Termux.

1. git clone https://github.com/Thriam/Thriam-MD
2. cd Thriam-MD
3. npm install or unzip the node_modules.zip
4. node index.js

and the file will be saved as "session.data.json" which can be renamed as "Thriam.json" or as needed at your convenience and be used in elsewhere.

This files are created by Thriam bakesvar B for educational purposes only.

Please do give a star.
